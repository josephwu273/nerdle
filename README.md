## Answer Rules

Most rules are outlined in https://faqs.nerdlegame.com/?faq but further clarifications appear below:

Exponents (`**`) will never be a nerdle solution but can be used in a guess: ~~`2**3+1=9`~~

Negative numbers will never be on either side of the equation. Negatives can be valid guesses: ~~`1-14=-13`~~ or ~~`10+-5=14`~~

Equations with *implcit* negative numbers CAN be nerdle solutions: `1-8+10=3` (implicit -7)

Equations with decimal points are not valid guesses or solutions but *implciit* decimals CAN be nerdle solutions: `5/2*4=10` (implicit 2.5)

Explciit positives are not valid solutions but can be valid guesses: `+6*1+1=7'
